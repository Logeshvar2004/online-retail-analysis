# online-retail-analysis

# Description:
It's a detailed analysis of online retail purchases which segment the customers based on purchasing behaviour using RFM analysis.

Task Done:
  - EDA(Exploratory data analysis)
  - RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetory)

Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing and business strategy. Understanding and categorizing customers into meaningful segments help in creating targeted marketing campaigns, improving customer satisfaction, and making data-driven business decisions.

The RFM model is used to segment customers based on three key metrics:
- **Recency:** Time since the last purchase.
- **Frequency:** Number of purchases made.
- **Monetary:** Total amount spent.

## Project Structure
- `eda.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for RFM analysis and customer segmentation.
- `onlineretail.xlsx`: Sample dataset used for analysis.
- `output.csv`: Output of RFM Analysis.
